My friend and I achieved third place in these competitions.


The Khayyam Competitions, held at the University of Neyshabur, are prestigious events aimed at promoting mathematics and fostering a deeper interest in the subject among students and scholars. Organized in collaboration with the Mathematics House and local education departments, these competitions challenge participants to solve innovative and creative problems. They provide a platform for students to showcase their talents, enhance their problem-solving skills, and engage in intellectual exchanges. Over the years, the Khayyam Competitions have become a symbol of excellence in mathematical education and continue to inspire the academic community.
In this competition, techniques such as text mining and sentiment analysis were utilized. These methods added a layer of depth to the problem-solving approach and highlighted the importance of data-driven insights.
