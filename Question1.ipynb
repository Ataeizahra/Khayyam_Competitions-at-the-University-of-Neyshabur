      "Sirohi, about ten thousand square miles in area, was the\n",
      "capital of the Sirohi State in Rajasthan, before India’s\n",

      "Mardia: It had a devastating effect. My father\n",
      "started taking life very philosophically and decided\n",
      "to take everything easy. His whole perspective of life\n",
      "changed. He passed on the family businesses to my\n",
      "uncles. One uncle was a compulsive gambler who\n",
      "piled up huge debts. Eventually, many of the family\n",
      "businesses and other assets (e.g., several buildings and\n",
      "movie theaters in and around Bombay) were lost as\n",

      "Mukhopadhyay: What about your mother’s side of\n",
      "the family?\n",
      "Mardia: My maternal grandfather was a lawyer and\n",
      "writer. He was an original thinker. He wrote a number\n",
      "of novels. Any writing skills I may have, I probably\n",
      "inherited from him.\n",

      "SCHOOL DAYS\n",
      "Mukhopadhyay: Where and how did your school-\n",

      "Mardia: In kindergarten, we learned numbers and\n",
      "even simple fractions. For example, at the age of four\n",
      "or ﬁve, we learned the concept of what is one-half\n",
      "of ten or one-quarter of eight! We had to memorize\n",
      "such multiplication tables and the teachers were very\n",
      "strict. We also had to learn to speak and write in Hindi,\n",
      "but this had to be mastered with the Rajasthani script\n",
      "and dialect, even though those styles were practically\n",
      "dead by then. It did feel like I was mastering a foreign\n",
      "language. This was on top of learning English.\n",
      "Mukhopadhyay: Did you happen to have some\n",
      "inspiring teachers?\n",
      "Mardia: In my time, there was only one high school\n",
      "in Sirohi, which I had to attend. Neither the teachers\n",
      "nor the curriculum had any ﬂexibility and I did not like\n",
      "most of the subjects very much, except for mathemat-\n",
      "ics. In the lower grades, we had a mathematics teacher\n",
      "who hailed from Ajmer, another part of Rajasthan, and\n",
      "he had an interesting habit. He used to assign challeng-\n",
      "ing mathematical puzzles to the class and gave small\n",
      "prizes to whoever could solve the puzzles ﬁrst. I was\n",
      "pretty good in solving such mathematical puzzles and\n",
      "won many prizes along the way. This math teacher had\n",
      "a big inﬂuence on me. I also enjoyed plane Euclidean\n",
      "geometry very much. I went through these construc-\n",
      "tions and proofs of theorems based on axioms. How-\n",
      "ever, I have to confess that I preferred algebraic deriva-\n",
      "tions and proofs with equations to the geometry-based\n",
      "arguments. (Laughs.)\n",
      "Mukhopadhyay: (Laughs) Kanti, in quiet moments,\n",
      "sometimes you probably think what an irony of life that\n",
      "was!\n",
      "Mardia: (Laughs) Nitis, you are right. Later in life,\n",
      "“geometry” became my mantra. What an irony indeed!\n",
      "I was not very interested nor considered particularly\n",
      "bright by others in nonmathematical subjects. I loved\n",
      "mathematics and sometimes I got into trouble because\n",
      "of this. Often I would come up with answers too\n",
      "quickly even for tricky problems. In higher grades,\n",
      "I became proﬁcient in the factorization of quadratic\n",
      "equations, but some teachers did not appreciate that\n",
      "very much. Some teachers misjudged me, thinking that\n",
      "I was trying to show off or I was probably too clever.\n",
      "I was just being my enthusiastic self.\n",
      "When I was about fourteen, I had to choose between\n",
      "the science stream or the arts stream. I did not care\n",
      "much about laboratory experiments and hence avoided\n",
      "pursuing the science stream. Instead I wanted to learn\n",
      "Sanskrit in the arts stream. So, I followed the arts\n",
      "stream.\n",
      "Mukhopadhyay: Did you take the matriculation\n",
      "examinations from the same school?\n",
      "Mardia: Yes, this was the only school in our area.\n",
      "I passed the matriculation examinations in 1951 and\n",
      "prepared for my transition to a college. But going to\n",
      "a college meant that I would have to migrate to another\n",
